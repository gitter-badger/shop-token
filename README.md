Smart contracts for SHOP token and sale in form of [Dutch auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_auction).

# Details

Auction duration is **30 days**, price per token unit exponentially decreases every day, all token units are being sold by the final bid price.

We're using [:page_facing_up: Pre-calculated Price Decay Rates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZqdmBoNK8sbgroBIxnbt9xCebFIfFZAtflxKLkSrplQ/edit?usp=sharing) to avoid overflows and reduce computations (and therefore, gas price) during bidding.

Auction stages:
* `AuctionDeployed`
* `AuctionSetup`
* `AuctionStarted`
* `AuctionEnded`
* `TokensDistributed`
